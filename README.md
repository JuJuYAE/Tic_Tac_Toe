# Tic_Tac_Toe

This is a game I made when learning python. Like the name describes, it is a TicTacToe game that can be played by two users. I used Jupyter Notebook IDE to program this and if you scroll to the end you can see the game being played by two users and ending in a draw

This was a project I was able to achieve while completing my bootcamp from Udemy taught by Jose Portilla ("The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero")
